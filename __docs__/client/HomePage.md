This is the welcome page.

Big centered title, with smaller motto below.

Search bar below that. Searching in it will bring you to the explore page with the search item as being searched. See the Explore page info for more.

Below, should be 3 hero sections, that look like [this](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/templates/framesx-web-blocks/). Note that this is made using Joy UI.

The first one should be about making quizzes that you make.
The second one should emphasize finding quizzes to test yourself in topics you are passionate about.
The third one should be about comparing and competing against others.

For the buttons on each hero section:
1. The first should link to the my quizzes page.
2. The second should link to the explore page, searching only for quizzes.
3. The third should link to the explore page, searching only for users.
